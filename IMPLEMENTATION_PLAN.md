- Add conversion to/from Python lists and numpy arrays

### 5. Create Python-friendly error handling ✅

## Phase 4: Transformer Blocks ✅ COMPLETED

### 8. Implement ScalarTransformer wrapper ✅
- Implemented ScalarTransformer with continuous value encoding
- Exposed min/max bounds, num_s, num_as configuration
- Added semantic similarity through overlapping encodings

- 19 comprehensive tests, all passing

### 9. Implement DiscreteTransformer wrapper ✅
- Implemented DiscreteTransformer with categorical encoding

- 12 comprehensive tests, all passing

## Phase 5: Learning Blocks ✅ COMPLETED

### 11. Wrap PatternPooler ✅
- Implemented PatternPooler for unsupervised learning
- Winner-take-all competitive learning with synaptic permanence
- Exposed compute, learn, execute methods with BitArray inputs
- Configuration: num_s, num_as, permanence parameters, pooling/connectivity percentages
- 11 comprehensive tests, all passing

### 12. Wrap PatternClassifier ✅
- Implemented PatternClassifier for supervised multi-class classification
- Per-label dendrite groups with probability distributions
- set_label(), get_probabilities(), get_predicted_label() methods
- Configuration: num_l, num_s, num_as, permanence and pooling parameters
- 10 comprehensive tests, all passing

## Phase 6: Temporal Blocks ✅ COMPLETED

### 13. Wrap ContextLearner ✅
- Implemented ContextLearner for temporal/contextual pattern recognition
- Dual-input learning: input and context patterns with separate BitArrays
- Exposed compute, learn, execute methods with both input and context
- Configuration: num_c, num_spc, num_dps, num_rpd, dendrite threshold, permanence parameters
- Anomaly detection: get_anomaly_score() returns 0.0-1.0 for prediction quality
- Historical tracking: get_historical_count() for learning capacity utilization
- Output access: output(), output_at(time), has_changed()
- 16 comprehensive tests, all passing

## Phase 7: Python API Design ✅ COMPLETED

### 14. Create Pythonic API layer ✅
- Created api.py module with convenience factory functions
- Factory functions: create_scalar_encoder(), create_category_encoder(), create_pooler(), create_classifier(), create_temporal_learner()
- Sensible default parameters for all learning blocks
- Simplified construction with readable parameter names
- Note: PyO3 classes cannot be subclassed, so properties/context managers were not feasible
- 6 comprehensive tests for API layer, all passing

### 15. Add type hints throughout ✅
- Type stubs (.pyi files) already exist for all Rust classes with complete signatures
- Added type hints to api.py convenience functions
- Verified mypy compatibility in strict mode (0 errors)
- Full type coverage for Python API layer

## Phase 8: Testing & Documentation ✅ COMPLETED

### 16. Write comprehensive test suite ✅
- Unit tests for all wrapped classes: 154 tests across 11 test files
- Integration tests for block pipelines: 9 tests covering encoder→pooler, encoder→classifier, temporal learning, multi-stage pipelines
- Property-based tests using hypothesis: 16 tests validating invariants across randomized inputs
- **Total: 179 tests, all passing**

### 17. Create documentation ✅
- Enhanced README.md with quick start examples, core components overview, and usage patterns
- Complete type stubs (.pyi files) for all classes with comprehensive docstrings
- Integration test examples demonstrating pipeline construction
- Note: Sphinx/Jupyter notebooks deferred (can be added in future phases as needed)

## Phase 9: Build & Distribution ✅ COMPLETED

### 18. Configure CI/CD ✅
- Created `.github/workflows/ci.yml` for continuous integration
  - Tests on Ubuntu, macOS, and Windows
  - Python versions: 3.9, 3.10, 3.11, 3.12, 3.13
  - Runs pytest, mypy type checking
  - Separate lint job with ruff
- Created `.github/workflows/release.yml` for automated releases
  - Builds wheels for all platforms using maturin-action
  - Builds source distribution (sdist)
  - Publishes to PyPI on GitHub releases
  - Uses trusted publishing (OIDC) for secure uploads

### 19. Prepare for PyPI distribution ✅
- Enhanced package metadata in pyproject.toml
  - Complete classifiers for Python versions and topics
  - Keywords for discoverability
  - Project URLs (homepage, repository, issue tracker)
  - Typed package marker
- Created LICENSE file (MIT)
- Created MANIFEST.in for source distribution
- Created CONTRIBUTING.md with development guidelines
- Package ready for `pip install gnomics`

## Architectural Decisions to Make

- **Memory management**: Decide on ownership model (clone vs. reference)
- **Parallelism**: Handle Rust's Send/Sync vs Python's GIL
- **Serialization**: Support pickle for Python objects
- **NumPy integration**: Tight integration for BitArray ↔ numpy arrays
- **Error handling philosophy**: Fail fast vs. graceful degradation

## Technology Stack

- **Build Tool**: maturin
- **Python Bindings**: PyO3
- **Testing**: pytest, hypothesis
- **Linting/Formatting**: ruff
- **Type Checking**: mypy
- **Documentation**: Sphinx
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions
